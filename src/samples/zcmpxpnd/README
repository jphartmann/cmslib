This sample shows how to use the zlib compression library.

Use "make up" to compile and upload the contents of the filter package.

On CMS:

Address COMMAND
signal on error
'GLOBAL MACLIB FPLGPI FPLOM DMSGPI FPLG2A'
'HLASM ZLIBSTG (TERM BATCH'
'EXEC FPLLINKP ZLIBSTG (LIB ZLIB'
signal off error
'NUCXDROP ZLIBSTG'
'ZLIBSTG'

The filter package contains two filters:

ZLIB COMPRESS|DEFLATE [<number>]

The number specifies the compression level from 0 (no compression) to 9,
which is the most aggressive.  A number that is not 0..9 is treated as
Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION.

ZLIB EXPAND|INFLATE

The programs operate on a byte stream; you will likely perform some kind
of blocking to retain record boundaries.  Adding a line end character is
likely to lead to most efficient compression, but ADDRDW SF4 is the most
general.
